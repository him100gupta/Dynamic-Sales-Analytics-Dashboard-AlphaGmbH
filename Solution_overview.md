## Solution Delivered
To meet Alpha GmbH’s requirements, I developed a dynamic Power BI dashboard with two main sections:

+ Sales Overview
+ Product and Territory Performance

These sections are easily navigable through bookmarks, enabling the client to toggle between different parts of the dashboard seamlessly.

### Sales Overview
This section delivers a high-level view of the company’s sales performance, including key insights into total sales, profit, and trends over time. The following features were implemented:

#### KPI
+ Total Sales Amount and Overall Profit KPIs provide an instant snapshot of the company’s financial health.
+ Average Profit per Order gives insight into the profitability of each transaction.
+ Sales KPI compares the current year’s sales performance with the previous year, helping to gauge growth.

#### Visualizations:

+ Overall Sales (Line Chart): Conditionally formatted to show the lowest sales points in red and the highest in green for easy interpretation.
+ Overall Quantity Sold (Area Chart): Similarly conditionally formatted, showing total quantities sold over time.
+ Sales vs Profit (Stacked Column Chart): Compares average sales and profit.
+ Sales Map: Geographically highlights sales distribution across countries, with bubble sizes representing sales volume, making it easy to see which regions are driving business.

### Dashboard Interactivity and User Experience
The dashboard is designed with user-friendly navigation in mind, allowing the client to easily toggle between the Sales Overview and Product & Territory Performance sections by clicking on the relevant tabs. The following interactive features were added:

+ Conditional formatting on key charts, making it easier for users to quickly spot trends and performance highs/lows.
+ Tooltips for each visualization, providing additional context on sales, profit, and product details as users hover over the charts.
